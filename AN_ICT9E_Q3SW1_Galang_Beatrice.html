	<h1 align="center">Bridgerton</h1>
	<p>Set against the backdrop of the Regency era, the eight close-knit siblings of the prominent and wealthy Bridgerton family – Anthony, Benedict, Colin, Daphne, Eloise, Francesca, Gregory and Hyacinth – navigate London high society in search of love and happiness, surrounded by friends and rivals alike.</p>

		<h4> Anthony Bridgerton </h4>

				<div class="col-8">
					<p> Anthony Bridgerton is the quintessential English nobleman and the older brother of: Benedict, Colin, Daphne, Eloise, Francesca, Gregory, and Hyacinth. He is the dutiful head of the family since assuming his late father's title of Viscount.</p>
				</div>
		<br>
		<h4>  Benedict Bridgerton </h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-4">
					<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/bridgerton/images/f/f8/Benedict_Bridgerton_5647.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220721224824" width="90%">
				</div>
				<div class="col-8">
					<p> Benedict Bridgerton is complex, incredibly privileged, and lost. But interestingly, for Benedict, it's imperative to focus on the fact that in the books, he's one of the quiet ones. The ones who can be forgotten at times. The ones who have all sorts of attention but never the enriching kind.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
		<h4>  Colin Bridgerton </h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-4">
					<img src="https://juliaquinn.com/WP/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WAX_colin.jpg" width="90%">
				</div>
				<div class="col-8">
					<p> Colin Bridgerton is tired of being thought nothing but an empty-headed charmer, tired of the neverending sameness of his life, and, most of all, tired of everyone's preoccupation with the notorious gossip columnist Lady Whistledown, who can't seem to publish an edition without mentioning him in the first paragraph.</p>
				</div>
		<br>
		<h4>  Daphne Bridgerton </h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-4">
					<img src="https://media.tatler.com/photos/6141ec23970aecd0f140d201/3:2/w_1920,h_1280,c_limit/bridgerton_101_unit_01005r-2-square.jpg" width="90%">
				</div>
				<div class="col-8">
					<p> Daphne Bridgerton is the first daughter and fourth child of Edmund and Violet Bridgerton. She is popular and enjoys spending time with friends and family. Kind and warm, she is confident in social situations and she instinctively knows what should or shouldn't be said.</p>
				</div>
		<br>
		<h4>  Eloise Bridgerton </h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-4">
					<img src="https://dnm.nflximg.net/api/v6/BvVbc2Wxr2w6QuoANoSpJKEIWjQ/AAAAQWw0V6Gx8b8jAWE4hYnVs1SkbsuADIZKVlpq0anvYwYG75bjphyr6y5_r6zOQZlaUEJr4xjM4fknLLsOJ3laYnoR98kqNINk10oPBNCGAmIZeNtEJoa7CldlD254lsdJUsfhmvJ8U0B4kDdvNG8_QYnH9Ek.jpg?r=185" width="90%">
				</div>
				<div class="col-8">
					<p> Witty, confident, and independent. Eloise has quite a few opinions and isn't afraid to share them with the world. Eloise thrives around other intellectuals, but she is more timid when it comes to finding a husband.</p>
